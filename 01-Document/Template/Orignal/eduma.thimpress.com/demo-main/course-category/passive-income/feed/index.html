<p>Users will feel the speed.<br />
Interchange now enables HTML partials for device specific content. Smoother animations and transitions happen with hardware acceleration. The default styles are all updated.</p>
<h4>FASTER TO CODE</h4>
<p>For the nerd in all of you,<br />
we&#8217;ve built a new command line tool to spin up projects fast and added Libsass, speeding up your SCSS changes by 5X. Our <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/templates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML Templates</a> have even been brought up to speed.</p>
<h4>FASTER TO LEARN</h4>
<p>We overhauled our documentation with all new and more detailed code examples. And we&#8217;re now supporting Foundation with a new <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forum</a> and expert training so you can get started building even faster.</p>
